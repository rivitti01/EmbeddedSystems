# 🌿 Leaf Health Classification (Healthy vs. Diseased Linden Tree Leaves)

This project provides a **machine learning model** to classify **linden tree leaves** as either **healthy** or **ill (diseased)**.  
The model was trained and optimized using **[Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/)** and exported as an **Arduino library**.  

The resulting model can run directly on **Arduino boards** that support TensorFlow Lite Micro.

## 🔧 Installation Tutorial: Deploying the Model on Arduino

Follow these steps to use the model on your Arduino board:

### 1. Install Arduino IDE
- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. Install Required Libraries
- Open Arduino IDE → **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries…**  
- Install:  
  - **Arduino_TensorFlowLite** (official TensorFlow Lite Micro support)  
  - **Arduino_LSM9DS1** or other sensor libraries (if required by your board)  

### 3. Add the Edge Impulse Model Library
- Download **`mobile_160_035_8_05_97Test.zip`** from this repository.  
- In Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library…**  
- Select the ZIP file.  
- The model will now appear under:  
  **File → Examples → mobile_160_035_8_05_97Test**

### 4. Run Example Code
- Open: **File → Examples → mobile_160_035_8_05_97Test → esp32 → esp32_camera**  
- Select your board (e.g., **ESP32S3 Dev Module**)  
- Upload the sketch  

### 5. Test the Model
- Provide input data (image or sensor pipeline as used in Edge Impulse).  
- The model outputs:  
  - `0` → Healthy Leaf  
  - `1` → Diseased Leaf
